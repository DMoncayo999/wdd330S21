  <h3>The Window Object</h3>

    <p>The window object (CHAPTER 09)
Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties
 of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global </br>
object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>

<p>The Browser Object Model
The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information 
about the browser and computer screen.
If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the keyword this in the global scope.</br>
 The following code provides a quick way of assigning the variable global to the global object:
// from within the global scope </br>
const global = this; <br/></p>

<p>Animation
The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. As an example, let’s create 
a web page that shows a colored square, and make it rotate.</p>

<p>HTML5 APIs
The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, 
geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers 
access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.

<p>HTML5 Web Storage</p>
The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer
 restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about 
 users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.
Here is a basic example of storing information. To save a value locally, use:</br>
localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');</br>
To illustrate that it’s being saved locally, try completely closing your browser, reopening it, and entering the following code
 in the console:</br>
localStorage.getItem('name'); </br>
<< "Walter White" </br></p>
