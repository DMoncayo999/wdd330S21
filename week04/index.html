    <h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Notes: Week 04</h2>
      <h3>Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms are made up of a <span style="color: red;"> form </span> element that contains form controls such as input fields,
             select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the 
             form has been submitted. </li>
            <li>Properties and Methods: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically.</li>
              <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the
               HTML.</li>
              <li>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Form Controls: </li>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="color: red;">input</span> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, 
              and file uploads</li>
              <li><span style="color: red;">select</span> menus for drop-down lists of options.</li>
              <li><span style="color: red;">textarea</span> elements for longer text entry</li>
              <li><span style="color: red;">button</span>  elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
            </ul>
        </ul> 
    
      <h3>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>   
            <li>OOP for short is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties
             and methods.</li>
            <li>Is often used to model representations of objects in the real world..</li>
            <li>There are three main concepts in OOP:</li>   
            <ul><li>encapsulation -- Keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement 
            the functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowit’s done.</li> 
            <li>polymorphism --Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods
             with a more specific implementation.</li>
             <li>inheritance -- We can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then 
             improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li> </ul>
            
      <h3>Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
      <p>Various frameworks and tools that can be employed to improve the quality of your code. In turn, it will make it more 
      organized and easier to maintain, promoting reuse. We’ll also look at how to make your applications ready for production.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Libraries</li>
            <p>It is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks.
            A good example of how libraries can help save time is in DOM manipulation</p>

        <li>Modular JavaScript</li>           
            <p>It is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other 
            files and by other modules.</p>

        <li>MVC frameworks</li> 
            <p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time in server-side languages.
             In recent years it has been used in JavaScript code to make it easier to organize large-scale web applications.<br/>
            <a href="practice/list.html">Week 04 Example of MVC Framework</a> This is a nice example of MVC frameworks. Simple,
            but easy to give us an idea about what it is about it, but in reality is very complex, but useful. I used with 
            PHP and SQL course last semester in CSE 340 class, and this semester in CSE 341 class with nodeJS and mongoDB.</p>
       
        <li>Package managers</li> 
            <p>A directory with one or more files of code, as well as a package.json file that contains information about the
             code in the package.  A package manager makes it easy to install, upgrade and remove any packages that are used in a 
             project. They also allow you to manage different versions of packages..</p>
       
       </ul>
        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I did not have experience with WEBPACK, but after followed the instruction for the exempla, when I wrote <br/>
            this command on the console  ./node_modules/.bin/webpack main.js bundle.js, give me a error message than a <br/>
            CLI for webpack must be installed. I said yes to the installation but I could not resolve yet the issue. I will be <br/>
            trying a little more this week.
            </li>
