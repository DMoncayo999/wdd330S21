    <h2>Notes Week 02</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="practice/second_practice.html">Week 02 exercises</a> The practice for functions with my team together 
        with the reading help me to refresh more about the different ways that we can do functions in JavaScript. Function
        declaration, funtion expression and arrow function. This last one, I like the most. It has a lot advantages but 
        also lose them when the funtion is longer than one line. I still like them, and agree with what in the book says is
        "more succinct by using less verbose syntax". (JS "Novice to Ninja" 2nd.edition by Darren Jones). </li>
        
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>While for funtion expression, when I was reading about them, I have questions, like, when the funtion assigned to
         a variable is excecuted as an anonymous function (it does not have name) and more when it is assinged a name, 
         wich one is executed, the variable or the funtion?. <br/>
         Ex.: const goodbye = function bye(){ <br/>
                console.log('Goodbye World!');<br/>
                }; 
        </li>
    </ol>
        
    </ul>
