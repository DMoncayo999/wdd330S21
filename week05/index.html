  <h3>Testing and debugging</h3>
    <ul>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Errors </span> are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
        <li> System error ― problem with the system or external devices. </li>
        <li> Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax, as simple as a typo.</li>
        <li> User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly. </li>
      <p><span style="color: red;">Exceptions</span> are errors that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. For <br/>
       example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent.<br/>
       Stack Traces: An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead <br/>
       to the point where the error occurred.</p>
       <p><span style="color: red;">Debugging Tools</span> Most modern browsers (Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Safari) also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points.
       One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that point. 
    </ul>
