  <h3>Client-side form validation</h3>

Client-side form validation
Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct 
format. 
Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on 
the client-side, the user can fix it straight away.
Client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security 
checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side..</p>

<p>What is form validation?
When you enter data (in a form), the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format 
and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while 
validation done on the server is called server-side validation. 
If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) 
saved in a database; if the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs 
to be corrected, and lets them try again.</p>

<p>There are three main reasons for validate our forms:
    <li> We want to get the right data, in the right format.</li> 
    <li> We want to protect our users' data.</li> 
    <li> We want to protect ourselves, malicious users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.</li></p>

<p>Types of client-side validation
There are two different types of client-side validation:
    <li> Built-in form validation </br>  This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation 
    has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</li>
    <li> JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create 
    it all or use a library.</li></p>

<p>Built-in form validation</br>
This is done by using validation attributes on form elements. 
    <li> <span style="color:red">required:</span> Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can 
    be submitted.</li>
    <li> <span style="color:red">minlength and maxlength:</span> Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data
     (strings)</li>
    <li> <span style="color:red">min and max:</span> Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
    <li> <span style="color:red">type:</span> Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some
     other specific preset type.</li> 
    <li> <span style="color:red">pattern:</span> Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data 
    needs to follow.</li>
If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, 
it is considered invalid.</p>

<p>Validating forms using JavaScript</br>
You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with legacy 
browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation.</p>

<p>The Constraint Validation API
Most browsers support the Constraint Validation API, which consists of a set of methods and properties available on the following 
form element DOM interfaces:</br>
    • HTMLButtonElement (represents a <span><</span>button<span>></span> element)<br/>
    • HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a <span><</span>fieldset<span>></span> element)<br/>
    • HTMLInputElement (represents an <span><</span>input<span>></span> element)<br/>
    • HTMLOutputElement (represents an <span><</span>output<span>></span> element)<br/>
    • HTMLSelectElement (represents a <span><</span>select<span>></span> element)<br/>
    • HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a <span><</span>textarea<span>></span> element)</p>

<p>Validating forms without a built-in API
In some cases, such as legacy browser support or custom controls, you won't be able to or won't want to use the Constraint 
Validation API.You're still able to use JavaScript to validate your form, but you'll just have to write your own.
To validate a form, ask yourself a few questions:<br/>
<li>What kind of validation should I perform?
You need to determine how to validate your data: string operations, type conversion, regular expressions, and so on. It's up to you.</li>
<li>What should I do if the form doesn't validate? This is clearly a UI matter. You have to decide how the form will behave.
Does the form send the data anyway? Should you highlight the fields that are in error? Should you display error messages?</li>
<li>How can I help the user to correct invalid data?
In order to reduce the user's frustration, it's very important to provide as much helpful information as possible in order to
guide them in correcting their inputs. You should offer up-front suggestions so they know what's expected, as well as clear error
messages.</li></p>
